simperium-ruby
==============
Simperium is a simple way for developers to move data as it changes, instantly and automatically. This is the Ruby library. You can [browse the documentation](http://simperium.com/docs/ruby/).

You can [sign up](http://simperium.com) for a hosted version of Simperium. Self-hosted options are on the way. There are Simperium libraries for [other languages](https://simperium.com/overview/) too.

This is not yet a full Simperium library for parsing diffs and changes. It's a wrapper for our [HTTP API](https://simperium.com/docs/http/) intended for scripting and basic backend development.
